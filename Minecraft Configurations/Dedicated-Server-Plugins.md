# On Bungeecord server only
Bungeecord, RedirectPlus BungeeCord plugin (for /home command)

# On Lobby server only
Multiverse-Core for disabling hunger (who wants to starve while browsing for a server, right?)

# On all servers
LuckPerms, SimplePortals, Essentials, FastAsyncWorldEdit

# LuckPerms configuration
This uses a MariaDB database with the 'global' configuration, where the Bungeecord server maintains the 'master list of permissions' to be sent to all servers.

We don't use per-server permissions with LuckPerms because we don't need it.
