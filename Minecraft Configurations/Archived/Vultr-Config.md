# List of Configuration Changes for the [Vultr](https://github.com/RHLUG-Org/MC-Project-Documentation-and-Scripts/blob/master/Infrastructure/Archived/Vultr.md) infastructure plan (April-May 2020)

- We disabled Nether and End worlds to reduce lag on all nodes with Minecraft services except the Overworld node's Minecraft service
- We are not using /op, we use LuckPerms to give admin permissions instead
- We like to use the LuckPerms web editor which requires a database (we used MariaDB which is like MySQL)
- We disabled Essentials Kits on all nodes with Minecraft services
